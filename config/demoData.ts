    summary: "An evidence-based guide to why atrophic scars form and how modern dermatologists combine subcision and lasers to restore skin uniformity.",
    content: "Acne scarring is a complex structural challenge. When a severe acne cyst heals, it often leaves behind fibrotic bands that pull the skin surface down, creating depressed or atrophic scars. Modern clinical dermatology has moved away from aggressive single-modality resurfacing. Instead, we use a combined approach: subcision to gently release those deep fibrotic anchors, paired with fractional energy (like Microneedling RF) to rebuild cellular collagen structure from within. This combined methodology achieves far more predictable, natural smoothing with a fraction of the traditional recovery downtime.",

    content: "Achieving healthy hair starts at the root—literally. Follicular thinning is driven by genetic DHT sensitivity, local inflammation, and micro-nutritional gaps. Rather than relying on commercial shampoos, an effective hair-stabilization plan relies on clinically validated topical therapies, follicle-level growth factor micro-infusions, and clarifying treatments that support a balanced scalp microbiome. Regular trichoscopy allows us to track follicle diameter and growth phases over time, making real-time adjustments before permanent miniaturization occurs.",

Our specialist dermatologists will evaluate your skin or scalp under magnification, diagnose your specific concern, and design a customized, evidence-based plan suitable for you.",
  },
  {
    id: "faq-2",
    question: "What happens during the first consultation?",
    answer: "Your initial consultation is a thorough, unhurried 30-minute session. We perform high-magnification diagnostics, review your full medical history, analyze your current lifestyle and skincare routine, and discuss your goals. We then provide an honest, clinical recommendation without any commercial pressure.",

  {
    id: "faq-3",
    question: "Can I book if I am unsure which treatment I need?",
    answer: "Absolutely. In fact, most of our new patients start exactly this way. Simply choose the general area of your concern (such as 'Skin Texture' or 'Hair Thinning') or select 'I am not sure' during our booking process. Your session will begin as an open diagnostic consultation.",

  {
    id: "faq-4",
    question: "How long does a consultation take?",
    answer: "A standard initial consultation takes approximately 30 minutes. If you decide to go ahead with certain simple, non-downtime procedures on the same day, additional time may be required, which we will discuss during your session.",

  {
    id: "faq-5",
    question: "Are treatment plans personalised?",
    answer: "Yes, entirely. We do not believe in pre-packaged beauty menus. Every face, skin type, and hair density is unique. Your dermatologist will customize the frequency, intensity, and combinations of clinical therapies to align with your recovery window, skin tolerance, and biological response.",
  },
  {
    id: "faq-6",
    question: "What should I bring to my appointment?",
    answer: "We recommend bringing a list of your current skincare products, active topical medications, and any recent blood work or medical reports related to your health. If possible, arrive with a clean, makeup-free face so we can assess your skin barrier accurately.",

    id: "faq-7",
    question: "How are follow-up consultations arranged?",
    answer: "Depending on your specific plan, follow-up consultations are scheduled at key biological milestones (typically 4 to 6 weeks apart) to evaluate your progress, adjust home-care formulas, and perform subsequent clinical steps. You can manage these easily online or through our reception desk.",
